          When Tyler was 17, several cows from the neighbors farm wondered
          over into his parents yard. Being the hero that he is, he took it upon himself to chase
          the cows out of his parents yard and back to his neighbors yard. He decided that the best way to
          do this was with some roman candles. By shooting roman candles at the cows, he was able to encouage
          them to return back their righful home. He also set 3 acres of his parents pasture on fire.
